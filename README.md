Syncs icon badge values when you dismiss notifications from the notification center!

Normally, dismissing a notification will keep the badge value the same, requiring you to manually open and close the app to clear its badge count. With this tweak, if you clear 1 notification, the badge value will decrease by 1; if you clear all notifications for an app, then its badge will disappear.

This way, you can manage your notifications solely from the notification center without needing to manually clear your badges as well.

Supports tapping the "Clear" button, swiping left to clear, and clearing all notifications in a group.

### Usage
