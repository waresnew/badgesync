Sync badges with the notification center!

Normally, dismissing a notification will keep the badge value the same, requiring you to manually open and close the app to clear its badge count. With this tweak, when you dismiss a notification, the badge count automatically updates to reflect the remaining notifications.

> eg. You have 5 iMessage notifications so the badge for iMessage is at 5. If you clear 1 notification from iMessage, then the badge value becomes 4 (and so on).

This way, you can manage your notifications solely from the notification center without needing to manually clear your badges as well.

### Usage

By default, all apps' badges will be synced to the notification centre. You can disable this functionality for some apps by going to BadgeSync's preferences in the Settings app.
