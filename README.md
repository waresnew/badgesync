Syncs icon badge values when you dismiss notifications from the notification center!

Normally, dismissing a notification will keep the badge value the same, requiring you to manually open and close the app to clear its badge count. With this tweak, when you dismiss a notification, the badge count automatically updates to reflect the remaining notifications.

> eg. You have 5 iMessage notifications so the badge for iMessage is at 5. If you clear 1 notification from iMessage, then the badge value becomes 4 (and so on).

This way, you can manage your notifications solely from the notification center without needing to manually clear your badges as well.

Supports tapping the "Clear" button, swiping left to clear, and clearing all notifications in a group.
